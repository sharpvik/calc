# DOMCA -- Dominican Calculator

Just a little experiment with Reverse Polish Notation and interpreters.

## How to Use

1. Clone or Download as ZIP;
2. Create a file with a _*.do_ format;
3. Write your expressions (don't forget the spaces!);
4. Launch a Terminal in the folder;
5. Launch DOMCA itself using `python`;

```dolang
// an example of a viable expression:
# 3 + 4 * 2 - ( 3 ^ 2 )
```

```bash
python do.py filename.do
```
